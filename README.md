# JUDSOUND

This is the repository of a DIY project aiming at producing an alarm clock / music player.


## Motivation

The idea is to create a small alarm clock / music player for the bedroom.

Too many devices sold to listen to music require you to fiddle with a phone and/or to stare at glaring screen.

That may be fine during the day, but in the middle of the night, the light will disturb you.

This is a big issue if you listen to music tracks (e.g., guided meditation) as a mean to put yourself back to sleep.

Also, you may want to consider that phones should not enter bed rooms.


## Specificities

- no screen

- no light

- relatively high quality sound

- small form factor

- manual control via physical buttons

- enclosure made of wood

- plugged into standard electricity socket

- built around a Raspberry Pi


## Constraints

- should be easy to do

- should take me little time

- I never did Python programming myself before, nor electronics, nor true wood working (but I have some experience in programming and DIY outside those areas)

Mind however that I do not mind spending some money to buy good tools or nice pieces.

I will document the cost, but this projects, especially since I did not have much equipment, makes no economic sense. That is not the point.


## Repository

In this repository I will try to document everything here as the project develops, so that other people could replicate this project or find some inspiration for their own projects.
